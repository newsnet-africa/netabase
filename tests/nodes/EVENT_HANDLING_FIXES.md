# Event Handling Fixes - Connection Tests

## Problem Summary

The connection tests in `discovery.rs` were failing to receive messages from the swarm thread because of configuration and timing issues in the message-passing architecture.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Missing Listen Addresses
The primary issue was that the default `NetabaseConfig` had an empty `listen_addresses` vector:
```rust
// Default configuration
listen_addresses: vec![], // Empty!
```

This meant the swarm thread wasn't listening on any addresses, so no network events (like `NewListenAddr`) were generated.

### Issue 2: Event Timing
Events were being generated and sent before test code could subscribe to the broadcast channel, causing tests to miss initial events.

### Issue 3: Protocol Name Format
Protocol names needed to start with a forward slash (`/protocol-name`) as required by libp2p.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Listen Addresses to Test Configurations
```rust
let config = NetabaseConfig::default()
    .with_storage_path("./test_storage".into())
    .add_listen_address("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/0".parse().unwrap());
```

### 2. Improved Event Collection Strategy
- Used proper timeouts with `tokio::time::timeout()`
- Implemented both blocking (`recv().await`) and non-blocking (`try_recv()`) patterns
- Added retry logic for event collection

### 3. Fixed Protocol Names
```rust
// Before
let netabase = Netabase::try_new_default("test_protocol").await?;

// After  
let netabase = Netabase::try_new_default("/test_protocol").await?;
```

### 4. Enhanced Test Structure
- Created subscribers immediately after swarm startup
- Added proper event categorization
- Improved error handling and diagnostics

## Test Results

All connection tests now pass successfully:

1. **`swarm_creation_and_basic_lifecycle`** - Verifies basic swarm startup/shutdown
2. **`event_reception_with_timeout_collection`** - Tests event collection with timeouts
3. **`event_reception_with_blocking_wait`** - Tests blocking event reception
4. **`dual_node_event_generation`** - Tests two nodes generating events simultaneously
5. **`swarm_event_categorization`** - Verifies different types of events are received

## Key Learnings

1. **Configuration Matters**: Default configurations must include necessary networking setup
2. **Event Timing**: In message-passing architectures, subscriber setup timing is critical
3. **Diagnostics**: Proper logging helped identify the root cause (0 listeners)
4. **Testing Patterns**: Different event collection patterns are needed for different scenarios

## Architecture Validation

These fixes confirm that the message-passing refactor is working correctly:
- ✅ Swarm thread runs independently
- ✅ Events are properly broadcast via channels
- ✅ Command-response pattern works for queries
- ✅ No shared state issues
- ✅ Clean shutdown process

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding default listen addresses to `NetabaseConfig::default()`
2. Add helper methods for test configuration setup
3. Implement event filtering for specific test scenarios
4. Add performance benchmarks for event throughput
