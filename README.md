# Netabase

Decentralized object store built on libp2p's Kademlia DHT for NewsNet.

## Project Status: Core Infrastructure Incomplete

The netabase crate provides foundational DHT functionality but requires significant development for production use. The main API and macro systems are partially implemented.

## Completed Components

### Core Netabase Structure
- [x] Basic Netabase struct with generic type parameters
- [x] Swarm lifecycle management with thread-based architecture

  - `swarm_command_sender` - Channel for sending commands to swarm
- [x] Basic CRUD operation interfaces:
  - `put()` - Store data in the DHT
  - `get()` - Retrieve data from the DHT  
  - `delete()` - Remove data from the DHT
- [x] Error handling with custom `NetabaseError` enum
- [x] Default implementation and builder-style constructor methods

### Configuration and Setup
- [x] Multiple constructor patterns:
  - `new_test()` - Basic test configuration

- [x] mDNS auto-connect functionality for peer discovery
- [x] Support for custom keypairs and database paths
- [x] Production configuration with default bootnodes

### Networking Infrastructure

  - Kademlia DHT for distributed storage
  - mDNS for local peer discovery
  - Identify protocol for peer identification
  - QUIC, TCP transport layers
  - TLS, Noise for encryption
  - Yamux for stream multiplexing
- [x] Swarm management with configurable bootnodes
- [x] Basic swarm start and close functionality
- [x] Network event handling infrastructure

### Macro System Foundation
- [x] Procedural macro crate structure (`netabase_macros/`)
- [x] Macro export utilities (`macro_exports/`)
- [x] Basic code generation infrastructure with syn/quote
- [x] AST manipulation utilities for derive macros

### Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Unit tests for configuration creation
